                        <h3>Fast Facts</h3>
                        <p>The 1st planet from the sun. Located 28.7 million miles, or 0.4 AU. A single day on Mercury lasts 58d 15h 30m while a full trip around the sun is completed in 88 days.</p>

                        <h3>Naming</h3>
                        <p>Recognized originally as two different stars in the morning and the evening, once the Greeks recognized that the two stars were one, they gave the planet the name Hermes for its fleeting motion. The Romans later renamed the planet after the messenger god Mercury.</p>

                        <h3>Unique Features</h3>
                        <h4>Geology</h4>
                        <p>Mercury appears to have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid, iron sulfide outer core layer, a deeper liquid core layer, and a solid inner core. This planet has the second-highest density in the solar system after Earth. The planet sports large impact basins and craters that are similar to Earth's moon. There are also two distinct plains that stretch across the surface.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
                        <p>The surface temperature ranges from 100 to 700K &#40;-173 to 427 C; -280 to 800 F.&#41; Despite these extremes, there is evidence of ice existing on or below the surface. The planet is too small and hot to retain an atmosphere but does possess a surface-bounded exosphere containing hydrogen, helium, oxygen, and sodium.</p>

                        <h3>Fast Facts</h3>
                        <p>The 2nd planet from the sun. Located 66.8 million miles, or 0.7 AU from the sun. A Venusian day lasts 116d 18h while a Venusian year takes 225 days.</p>

                        <h3>Naming</h3>
                        <p>Venus was known as 'the Great White' or the 'the Starter of Brightness' by the ancient Chinese. The Romans named the planet after the Goddess of Love and Beauty, also known as the Greek Goddess Aphrodite.</p>

                        <h3>Unique Features</h3>
                        <h4>Geology</h4>
                        <p>The surface is mostly covered in volcanic plains from the volcanism taking place on the planet. Unlike Earth, the crust of Venus is older and not subject to the same plate erosion resulting in a surface that is 3 to 6 times older than the Earth.</p>

                        <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
                        <p>Venus has an extremely dense atmosphere composed of 96 percent carbon dioxide that exists as a supercritical fluid on the surface. The pressure and mass of the atmosphere is about 92 times greater than Earth's and has a surface pressure equivalent to 1km under Earth's oceans. Venus also records the highest planetary temperatures in the Solar System with an average temperature of 737K. &#40;464 C; 867 F&#41; </p>

                        <h3>Naming</h3>
                        <p>Named after the Roman God of War due to the reddish color of the planet reminiscent of blood.</p>

                        <h3>Unique Features</h3>
                        <h4>Geology</h4>
                        <p>The surface consists of minerals containing silicon, oxygen, and metal. Home to the tallest mountain, Olympus Mons and deepest canyon, Valles Marineris, in the Solar System.</p>

                        <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
                        <p>The highest atmospheric density on Mars is equal to that found 35km above Earth's surface. The air consists of about 96 percent carbon dioxide, 2 percent argon, 2 percent nitrogen, and a mix of trace elements such as water vapor.</p>
