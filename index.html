                        <h3>Fast Facts</h3>
                        <p>The 3rd planet from the sun. Located 91.5 million miles from the sun, also known as 1 AU
                            &#40;Astronomical Unit&#41;. Day length is 24 hours while the year length is 365 days. The
                            Earth has one moon. The only planet confirmed to support life in the known universe.</p>

                        <h3>Naming</h3>
                        <p>Also known as Gaia, Terra, Tellus, the world, and the globe. The name Earth may have roots as
                            a personified goddess in Germanic paganism. The word is commonly written in lowercase as it
                            was in early Middle English. Occasionally, the name Terra is used in scientific writing and
                            science fiction to distinguish humanity's inhabited planet from others.</p>

                        <h3>Unique Features</h3>
                        <h4>Geology</h4>
                        <p>Earth has plate tectonics, volcanism, ice, vast surface oceans, mountains, rivers, forests,
                            deserts, and more. Plate tectonics form new crust and cycle older crust into the mantle to
                            continually refresh the surface when paired with erosion.</p>

                        <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
                        <p>The air is composed of about 70 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, 1 percent argon, and a
                            mix of trace gases such as carbon dioxide. Earth maintains temperatures and pressure to
                            accommodate liquid water on the surface, which in turn provides water vapor to maintain and
                            regulate global temperatures.</p>

                        <h3 id="moon">Moons</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Earth has one moon that is known by names such as Luna, Selene, and Cynthia. It orbits
                            384,000km &#40;238,900mi&#41; from Earth and has a surface gravity that is about one-sixth
                            that of Earth's.

                        <h3>Web Security</h3>
                        <p>
                            Web security is an integral part of staying safe on the web. Balancing functionality and privacy should be a primary concern for web security. Data about your browser could be helpful for applications wanting to provide you with a better experience, but that same data could be used against you. For instance, targeting users who have a particular version of a browser could be used to exploit them for know issues in out-of-date applications. Exploitation from one point could bring an entire host of problems to a user, everything from someone impersonating you, deleting data with your privileges, to stealing your data and holding it for ransom. Web security is also crucial for developers and companies. Denial-of-Service attacks are a common way to affect websites and negatively impact the brand's reputation.
